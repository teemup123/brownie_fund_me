brownie cannot import mpm packages but it can download directly from github 
    create a dependency on brownie-config.yaml and specify
        - <organization/repo>@<version>
        - make sure to remap your @<package>
    the dependencies will show up under build/contract/dependencies
* There was a problem with importing safemath for openzeplin so I just use version 0.8.8 instead which have safemath built in
* When working in console, it is best practice to create __init__.py so that it knows to where to import from 
* After deploying the smart contract using brownie, go to etherscan to verify and publish it
    * This API associated with the etherscan account will automatically verify the contract for you
        by adding the FundMe.deploy({"from": account}, publish_source = True). 
    * Once on etherscan, you can interact with the contract just like in Remix

To deploy to local block-chain 
    * WITH an oracle feed
        You can 
            1. Fork simulated chain 
            2. Deploy a mock on local development chain <- let's go with this 
    * To create a mock - go to contracts/ section
        1. create test file 
        2. create <mock_file>.sol : this is where we add code to mock the pricefeed 
            many mocks can be found in chainlink mix repository
